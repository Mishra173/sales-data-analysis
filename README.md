  Sales Data  Analysis

This project analyzes a Kaggle sales dataset using MySQL. 
The goal was to understand business performance such as revenue, profit, order trends, and top‑selling items.

I wrote more than 20 SQL queries and added clear comments so each query is easy to understand and reuse.

Dataset

The dataset contains order information such as:
OrderDate, OrderID, Country, Region, SalesChannel, ItemType, UnitSold, Revenue, UnitCost, Cost and Profit.

(Table name used: sales_data)

Tool Used
- MySQL Workbench

What this project shows

- Total revenue, profit and cost  
- Monthly revenue & profit trends  
- Top items  by sales  
- Country and region performance  
- Order priority insights  
- Processing time and shipping analysis  

Each query has a short description above it.
